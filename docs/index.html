				<span class="info">Color Research and Application, August, 2014.</span>
				<details>
					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>Color schemes or color combinations are widely used in printed materials and their digital versions, including web pages. These schemes convey information and create aesthetic appeal. Consequently, graphic designers have to strike a balance between accessibility and aesthetics with the color schemes they select. However, certain color schemes make the represented information confusing when viewers have color vision deficiencies (CVDs), which may lead to decrease in discriminability between used colors. What we will call the color-scheme-recoloring problem is the difficulty of optimizing a color scheme so as to preserve its original design and yet be simultaneously discriminable for all viewers, with or without CVDs. To address the problem, we formulated it within a framework of a fuzzy constraint satisfaction problem, a technique of artificial intelligence, and developed a tool for graphic designers. By utilizing the practical color co-ordinate system (PCCS), we introduce concepts used in the field of graphic design. This work combines pre-publication recoloring techniques for CVD viewers with elements of artificial intelligence, psychophysics, and psychology.</p>

					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>This paper proposes an application that analyzes and displays electrocardiograms (ECG; electrical activity of the heart over time) and plethysmograms (PTG; pulse waves produced by the heart pumping blood to the periphery) measured simultaneously. Recently in developed countries, chronic conditions typified by lifestyle-related diseases have become the leading cause of death. Simplified monitoring of the condition can be an effective approach to disease prevention and health promotion. We have focused on autonomic nervous system activity (ANSA) because it responds to stress as well as to changes in dietary patterns, and is correlated with hypertension, the source of some diseases, such as coronary disease. In this paper, we deal with both ECGs and PTGs as part of the biological data that reflects ANSA. The proposed application enables doctors to seamlessly negotiate analyzed waveforms and index charts of ECGs and PTGs in sync with each other. It also helps them comprehend the transition of ANSA. It offers a user interface (UI) that enables doctors to observe the two measures and the relationship between them for a quick assessment of ANSA; the sonification function of the ECG indices is implemented for providing the multi-modality of the UI. An experiment was conducted to confirm the feasibility of the analysis method of the application.</p>

					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>The material identification is a pressing requirement for the sensitive security applications. Dual-energy X-ray computer tomography (DXCT) has been investigated for material identification in the medical and security fields. It requires two tomographic images at sufficiently different energies. To discriminate dangerous materials of light elements such as plastic bombs in luggage, it is needed to measure accurately with several tens of kilo electron volts where such materials exhibit significant spectral differences. However, CT images in that energy region often include artifacts from beam hardening. To reduce these artifacts, a novel reconstruction method has been investigated. It is an extension of the Al-gebraic Reconstruction Technique and Total Variation (ART-TV) method that reduces the artifacts in a lower-energy CT image by referencing it to an image obtained at higher energy. The CT image of a titanium sample was recon-structed using this method in order to demonstrate the artifact reduction capability.</p>

				<details>
					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>This paper presents a software tool to intuitively comprehend and analyze fuzzy constraint satisfaction problems (FCSPs) through effective visualization with animation. FCSPs are an extension of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), which are used for formulating problems in real-world information systems. Once we formulate a problem as an FCSP, it can be solved (in principle) by any existing general-purpose FCSP solvers developed so far. However, the formulation is sometimes difficult because it requires high abstraction of real-world problems and affects the performance of the solvers. The authors believe that the tool will improve this situation by increasing the visibility of the behavior of the solvers.</p>

					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>A graphical user interface is equipped with an adaptive layout when it holds the ability to dynamically adjust its layout and structure of widgets based on conditions that evolve over time coming from the end user, the platform used, and the environment. More specifically, such a layout automatically adapts itself depending on the window dimensions of the application, the screen resolution, and the screen size, thus posing a series of constraints that, sometimes, could not be entirely satisfied together at once. To cope with this variation, we formulate the adaptive GUI layout as a fuzzy constraint satisfaction problem in which the solver attempts to satisfy the most important constraints first, such as an appropriate widget selection, then the least important constraints after.</p>

					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>We formulate the class responsibility assignment (CRA) problem as the fuzzy constraint satisfaction problem (FCSP) for automating CRA of high quality. Responsibilities are contracts or obligations of objects that they should assume, by aligning them to classes appropriately, quality designs realize. Typical conditions of a desirable design are having a low coupling between highly cohesive classes. However, because of a trade-off among such conditions, solutions that satisfy the conditions moderately are desired, and computer assistance is needed. Additionally, if we have an initial assignment, the improved one by our technique should keep the original assignment as much as possible because it involves with the intention of human designers. We represent such conditions as fuzzy constraints, and formulate CRA as FCSP. That enables us to apply common FCSP solvers to the problem and to derive solution representing a CRA. The conducted preliminary evaluation indicates the effectiveness of our technique.</p>

					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>The authors propose a method for personalizing the flexible widget layout (FWL) by adjusting the desirability of widgets with a pairwise comparison method, and show its implementation and that it actually works. Personalization of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is important from a perspective of usability, and it is a challenge in the field of model-based user interface designs. The FWL is a model- and optimization-based layout framework of GUIs offering a possibility for personalization, but it has not actually realized it with any concrete method yet. In this paper, the authors implement a method for personalization as a dialog box and incorporate it into the existing system of the FWL; thus, users can personalize layouts generated by the FWL system at run-time.</p>

					<p>We propose a new service composition method with the analytic hierarchy process and discuss its availability. The concept of context-aware services has been attracting attention as an approach to improving the usability of computer-mediated services. In ubiquitous computing environments, there are several means to provide services for users, and thus, to select an appropriate mean among them is a challenge. Our method for context-aware service composition determines service behaviors by context data. Through the implementation and examination of the method, we have found that the method can output reasonable results.</p>

					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>We show an improvement of our previous work, a formulation of the flexible widget layout (FWL) problem as a fuzzy constraint satisfaction problem (FCSP) and a method for solving it. The automation of widget layout is one of the most important challenges for the generation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In the field of model-based user interface design, widget layout is more complicated because a layout system needs to select widgets. FWL is the automatic GUI generation requiring (1) deciding which widgets are used and (2) completing the layout immediately. We formulate the desirability of selection as fuzzy constraints; thus, we can utilize existing techniques of FCSP without extending its framework. We divide the layout process into three phases, and realize the automatic layout in feasible time.</p>

					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>A fuzzy constraint satisfaction problem is an extension of the classical CSP, a powerful tool for modeling various problems based on constraints among variables, and a dynamic CSP is a framework for modeling the transformation of problems. These schemes are the technique to formulate real world problems as CSPs more easily. The CSP model that combines these is already has splendid researches. The Fuzzy Local Change algorithm is practicable enough in small-scale problems, but larger problems require the use of approximate methods. The algorithms for solving CSPs are classified into two categories: systematic searches (complete methods based on search trees), and local searches (approximate methods based on iterative improvement). Both have advantages and disadvantages.</p>
					<p>In the work reported in this paper we tested a hybrid approximate method, called the Spread-Repair-Shrink algorithm, on dynamic, large-scale problems. The algorithm repairs local constraints by repeatedly spreading and shrinking a set of search trees until the degree to which the worst constraints (the roots of the trees) are satisfied is improved. In this process, the "stability" of solutions can be maintained because the reassignment is locally limited. Additionally, we innovate SRSD filter as after filtering. We empirically show that Spread-Repair-Shrink and SRSD algorithm keep the stability of solutions rather than other algorithms. It is able to quickly get a good-quality approximate and stabile solution to a large problem.</p>

					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>We propose a new solution named interface client/logic server (ICLS), targeting dialog-based interactive services, supporting user interface (UI) migration, and offering adaptive UIs for devices and services. Constant improvements of technology have brought a large variety of platforms, and that has made users' new demands about the services. The first is that the users would like to use services through different devices and modalities depending on their use contexts. The second is that the users would sometimes like to change devices and take their tasks from one to another, which is called UI migration. Our architecture ICLS is designed based on client/server model. In ICLS, we use XML documents written in abstract interaction description language (AIDL) as logical descriptions of UIs, and introduce one of the semantic web technologies adding the function of expressing meanings of interactions.</p>

It enables users to select various devices and services according to their different needs before or during service sessions. AIDL enables our architecture ICLS to handle interactions of specific service domains maintaining the independence of services from specific devices and modalities.</p>

					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>We propose a new solution for the flexible widget layout (FWL) problem, formulating this problem as a fuzzy constraint satisfaction problem (FCSP) in the field of artificial intelligence. Widget layout performed by computers is one of the most important challenges for automatic generation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In the field of model-based user interface design, the widget layout is more complicated because the process of selecting widgets is needed. The FWL, we named, is the automatic GUI generation, which requires both (1) deciding which widget types and their alignments are used and (2) completing the layout in a certain time especially when the system generates them in run time. Our system automatically selects appropriate widgets and lays them out in certain rectangles. We formulate the desirability of the selection straightforward as fuzzy constraints; therefore, we can utilize existing technique of FCSP for the FWL. We divide the layout process into three phases, and using an existing FCSP algorithm, we realize the layout in a short time enough not to keep users of the generated GUI waiting.</p>

					<summary>Abstract</summary>
					<p>For user-preferred interfaces, we propose a service architecture, the Interface-Client/Logic-Server (ICLS). It separates specific interfaces from services. An ICLS-based service consists of some interface clients and a logic server. The target of this work is the services with intermediary computers in various scenes of our daily activities. Nowadays, against various users' characteristics, the services offer different UIs individually, and they are mostly single GUI. In ICLS, users can switch interfaces of services to suit their preferences and to customize flexibly. Interface clients and logic servers work together independently with common descriptions of interaction. Those descriptions are written in the Abstract Interaction Description Language (AIDL), we propose. AIDL is an application of semantic web technologies, and describes interactions as graphs. These graphs represent a specification of interfaces and the current state of interactions constantly. We propose a framework of ICLS-based service design. Developers can use it like GUI toolkits. With this framework, we developed three clients and two servers.</p>

						We propose an improvement of our previous work, a formulation of the flexible widget layout (FWL) problem as a fuzzy constraint satisfaction problem (FCSP). Automatic widget layout is an important challenge for the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) generation. In the field of model-based user interface design, the layout is more complicated because to select widgets is needed. FWL is GUI generations with deciding which widgets are used. In this paper, we improve our previous work so that the formulation coincides more strictly with FCSP.

						We propose a new solution named interface client/logic server (ICLS), targeting dialog-based interactive services, supporting user interface (UI) migration, and offering adaptive UIs for devices and services. Constant improvements of technology have brought a large variety of platforms, and that has made users' new demands about the services. The first is that the users would like to use services through different devices and modalities depending on their use contexts. The second is that the users would sometimes like to change devices and take their tasks from one to another, which is called UI migration. Our architecture ICLS is designed based on client/server model. In ICLS, we use XML documents written in abstract interaction description language (AIDL) as logical descriptions of UIs, and introduce one of the semantic web technologies adding the function of expressing meanings of interactions.
